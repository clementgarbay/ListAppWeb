## TODO

- [ ] improve type checking (with more Flow type declarations and more annotations)
- [ ] try to generify `core/items/index` and `core/lists/index`
- [ ] add a filter system (for instance: to show only completed items)
- [ ] improve errors management
- [ ] replace bad `prompt()` and `confirm()` functions usage !
