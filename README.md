# ListApp (web version)

A simple list app which allows you to create various lists with items. Useful for shopping list, task list, or what you want!

Built with React, Redux and Firebase.

# TODO

- [ ] restructure data storage in Firebase (use embedded items)
- [ ] improve type checking (with more Flow type declarations and more annotations)
- [ ] try to generify `core/items/index` and `core/lists/index`
